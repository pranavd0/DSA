## Problem Description

Given an array arr[] of positive integers, where each value represents the number of chocolates in a packet. Each packet can have a variable number of chocolates. There are m students, the task is to distribute chocolate packets among m students such that: Each student gets exactly one packet. The difference between maximum number of chocolates given to a student and minimum number is minimum and return that minimum possible difference. Examples: Input: arr = [3, 4, 1, 9, 56, 7, 9, 12], m = 5 Output: 6 Explanation: The minimum difference between maximum chocolates and minimum chocolates is 9 - 3 = 6 by choosing m packets as [3, 4, 9, 7, 9]. Input: arr = [7, 3, 2, 4, 9, 12, 56], m = 3 Output: 2 Explanation: The minimum difference between maximum chocolates and minimum chocolates is 4 - 2 = 2 by choosing m packets as [3, 2, 4]. Input: arr = [3, 4, 1, 9, 56], m = 5 Output: 55 Explanation: With 5 packets for 5 students, each student will receive one packet, so the difference is 56 - 1 = 55. Constraints: 1 ≤ m ≤ arr.size ≤ 105 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 109
