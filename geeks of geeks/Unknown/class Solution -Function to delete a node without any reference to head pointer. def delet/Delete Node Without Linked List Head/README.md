## Problem Description

Given a node x in a singly linked list, delete this node without access to the head of the linked list. The driver code will print the updated linked list to verify the deletion. Note: It is guaranteed that x is not the last node of the linked list. Examples: Input: x = 1 Output: 2 Explanation: After deleting 1 from the linked list, only 2 remains. Input: x = 20 Output: 10 -> 4 -> 30 Explanation: After deleting 20 from the linked list, we have remaining nodes as 10, 4, 30.
