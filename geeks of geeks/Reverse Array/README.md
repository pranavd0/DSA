## Problem Description

You are given an array of integers arr[]. You have to reverse the given array. Note: Modify the array in place. Examples: Input: arr = [1, 4, 3, 2, 6, 5] Output: [5, 6, 2, 3, 4, 1] Explanation: The elements of the array are [1, 4, 3, 2, 6, 5]. After reversing the array, the first element goes to the last position, the second element goes to the second last position and so on. Hence, the answer is [5, 6, 2, 3, 4, 1]. Input: arr = [4, 5, 2] Output: [2, 5, 4] Explanation: The elements of the array are [4, 5, 2]. The reversed array will be [2, 5, 4]. Input: arr = [1] Output: [1] Explanation: The array has only single element, hence the reversed array is same as the original.
